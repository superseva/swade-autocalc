 It will re-calculate PARRY value in case you
 1. ADD/MODIFY Fighting skill value (probably only working with english language)
 2. CHANGE Parry modifier field value. 
 You can still change Parry field value manually but if you do anything from above it will recalculate.

 It will re-calculate TOUGHNESS value in case you:
 1. CHANGE Vigor Dice value.
 2. ADD or EQUIP an item that has armor value
 3. CHANGE Toughness modifier field.
 4. CHANGE size value. 
 You can still change Toughness field value manually but if you do anything from above it will recalculate.
